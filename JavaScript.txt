$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Started Learning JavaScript On The 20th October, 2021 @ KTU Getfund B007 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

    [ Setting Up For JavaScript ]
JavaScript can be runned on both browser and IDE, BUT The best is to use an IDE Like VS Code.
along with the IDE, download and install node.js on the PC. 

Open VS Code, Open a folder, create a new file called 'index.html'
Also in VS Code extention, find and install live server 
right click on 'index.html' and select 'Open with Live Server'


    
    [ First JavaScript Program ]

As a best pratice, add JavaScript elements at the botton of the body section, unless 
you're using third party then import in the head section.

    [ Comments In JavaScript ]
Short = [ // ]
Long = [ /* */ ]



    [ Separation Of Concerns In JavaScript ]

HTML is all about content, and JavaScript Is All about Behavour. So we have to separate
these two files, create a new file called 'index.js' and reference it to 'index.html'
Like this: [ <script src="index.js"></script> ]  



    [ JavaScript In Node ]

To run JavaScript in Node, Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder you're working in,
and type this Code: [ node index.js ] were 'index.js' is the name of the JavaScript file.



    [ Variables In JavaScript ]

NOTE: The defualt value of Variables in JavaScript is undefined.

[ Rules in naming Variables in JavaScript ]
[1] Cannot be a reserved keyword
[2] Should be meaningful
[3] Cannot start with a number
[4] Cannot contain space or hyphen(-)
[5] Use the camel notation eg: 'myNameIsBoy'

My first JavaScript Variables = [ let name = 'Theophilus'; ]

-- EXAMPLES --
let nice_Day = `James`;
let money = 778.0;
console.log(`how do you do ${nice_Day}`); 
console.log(`how much do you have in your account: $${money}`);

    [ Constants Variables In JavaScript ]
Constants Variables are used to store values, that are not to be changed.
eg: [ const interestRate = 0.3; ]



    [ Datatypes In JavaScript ]
In JavaScript we have two main types which are: Primitives(Value Types) and Reference Type.
Under the Primitives Type, we have the following: String, Number, Boolean, Undefine, and Null.
[ let isApproved = true; ]
[ let qwerty; ] = Undefine Variable
[ let selectedColor = null; ] = 'null' is used to clear the value of the Variable.

Under the Reference Type, we have the following: Objects, Array, and Functions.



            [ JavaScript is a Dynamic language ]

In programming, there are two types of languages: Static, and Dynamic. Where with the Static
the Datatype of a Variable Cannot be changed to another Datatype later in the Program.

But, with the Dynamic based programming languages Like JavaScript,
Datatypes can be changed to other Datatypes later in the Program. 

You can check the Datatype of a Variable with this operator: [ 'typeof' ] see example below:
[
    let isApproved = true;

    console.log(typeof isApproved);
    isApproved = 'Ghana';
    console.log(typeof isApproved);
]

In JavaScript we don't have int, float, double and so on,
They're all classified as 'number' in JavaScript programming language.



        [ Objects In JavaScript ]
AN OBJECT IS A COLLECTION OF RELATED PROPERTIES AND/OR METHODS
CAN REPRESENT REAL WORLD OBJECT: people, products, places.

The code below is an example of how to create an Object:
[
    let person = {
        name: 'Theophilus',
        age: 23,
        say_HELLO: function () {console.log(`i'm ${this.name}`)}
    };
]

The code below is an example of how to read the content of the 'person' Object:
[ console.log(person.name); ] This prints the value of 'name' to the console.
[ console.log(person['name']); ] Same here.

The code below is an example of how to change the value of a key in the 'person' Object:
[ person.name = 'Shampileele'; ] 
[ person['name'] = 'Shampileele'; ]



        [ Arrays In JavaScript ]

The code below is an example of how to create an Array In JavaScript:
[ let selectedColor = ['blue', 'white']; ]

The code below is an example of how to access the content of the Array:
[ console.log(selectedColor[0]); ]

The code below is an example of how to write to the Array:
[ console.log(selectedColor[2]) = 'green'; ]

To Add new value to array(last) use code below
[ selectedColor.push(`yellow`); ]

To Add new value to the Begining of an array, use code below
[ selectedColor.unshift(`pick`); ]

To remove value from the Begining of an array, use code below
[ selectedColor.shift(); ]

To remove the last value in an array use code below
[ selectedColor.pop(); ]

To get length of an array, use code below
[ selectedColor.length ]

To find the index of value(color), use code below
[ selectedColor.indexOf("blue") ]

To get every value from array, you can use the for-LOOP
[
    for (let index = 0; index < selectedColor.length; index++) {
        console.log(selectedColor[index])
    }
    // ADVANCED
    for (let color of selectedColor) {
        console.log(color);
    }
]

To sort(alphabetical order) an array, you can use the sort method
[ selectedColor.sort(); ]

To sort an array in reverse, use the code below.
[ selectedColor.sort().reverse(); ]

The Array is an Object with properties you can access using the '.' operator try it out.



        [ Functions In JavaScript ]

The code below is an example of how to create a Function In JavaScript:
[
    function greet() {
        console.log('Hello World');
    }
]

The code below is an example of how to call a Function in JavaScript:
[ greet(); ]

Working with parameter and arguments in JavaScript:
[
    function greet(name, lastName) {
        console.log('Hello ' + name + ' ' + lastName);
    }

    greet('Theophilus', 'Tetteh');
]



        [ Types Of Functions In JavaScript]

The code below is an example of a Function in JavaScript:
[
    function square(number) {
        return number * number
    }

    console.log(square(2));
]

    username = window.prompt(`enter your username: `)
]

// PROFESSIONAL WAY
[

// MATH in JavaScript \\
Math is a built-in javascript object that provides a collection of Math related properties and methods.
EXAMPLES [
    [ Math.PI ] = This gives the value of 'pi'.
    [ Math.E ] = This gives the value of 'E = 2.71828...' KNOWN AS Euler's Number.
    [ Math.round(variable_Name) ] = you can round a number here.
    [ Math.ceil(variable_Name) ] = you can always round-up a number here.
    [ Math.floor(variable_Name) ] = you can always round-down a number here.
    [ Math.trunc(variable_Name) ] = this will remove every decimal, and show only the whole number.
    [ Math.pow(x, y) ] = {'x' to the power of 'y'} the power method (rise to the power).
    [ Math.floor(variable_Name) ] = you can always round-down a number here.
    [ Math.sqrt(variable_Name) ] = this method is for square root.
    [ Math.abs(variable_Name) ] = to get the absolute value of a number.( '-3.45' will be '3.45' ).
    [ Math.sign(variable_Name) ] = to get the sign of a number ( '-5.67'='-1', '5.67'='1', '0'='0' )
    [ Math.max(variable_Name, variable_Name, variable_Name) ] = get biggest number.
    [ Math.min(variable_Name, variable_Name, variable_Name) ] = get smallest number.
    [ Math.random() ] = this will generate random numbers BETWEEN '0' and '1'.
    [ Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) ] = this will generate random numbers BETWEEN '0' and '6' WIHTOUT DECIMALS.
    
    // RANDOM NUMBERS BETWEEN '50' and  '100'
    const mim = 50;
    const max = 100;
    let random_number = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - mim)) + mim;

]



// RANDOM NUMBER in JavaScript \\
HOW TO CREATE RANDOM NUMBERS [
    [ Math.random() ] = this will generate random numbers BETWEEN '0' and '1'.
    [ Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) ] = this will generate random numbers BETWEEN '0' and '6' WIHTOUT DECIMALS.
]

///// -- PROJECT 2 -- RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR \\\\\
PROGRAM [
    const myButton = document.getElementById(`myButton`);
    const myLabel = document.getElementById(`myLabel`);

    const min = 1;
    const max = 6;
    let random_Num;

    myButton.onclick = function () {
        random_Num = Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min;
        myLabel.textContent = random_Num;
    }
]

[
    if (condition) {
        
    }
    else if () {

    } 
    else {
        
    }
]



// THE CHECKED PROPERTY IN JAVASCRIPT \\
THE CHECKED PROPERTY DETERMINES THE CHECKED STATE OF AN HTML CHECKBOX OR A RADIO BUTTON ELEMENT.

BY EXAMING THIS PROPERTY WE DETERMINE WETHER CHECKBOX OR RADIO BUTTON IS SELECTED.

EXAMPLE
[
    const myCheckBox = document.getElementById(`myCheckBox`);
    const visaBtn = document.getElementById(`visaBtn`);
    const masterCardBtn = document.getElementById(`masterCardBtn`);
    const payPalBtn = document.getElementById(`payPalBtn`);
    const mySubmit = document.getElementById(`mySubmit`);
    const subResult = document.getElementById(`subResult`);
    const paymentResult = document.getElementById(`paymentResult`);

    mySubmit.onclick = function (){

        // CHECK-BOX
        if (myCheckBox.checked) {
            subResult.textContent = `You are Subscribed!`;
        } else {
            subResult.textContent = `You are NOT Subscribed!`;
        }

        // RADIO BUTTONS
        if (visaBtn.checked) {
            paymentResult.textContent = `You are paying with Visa`;
        }
        else if (masterCardBtn.checked) {
            paymentResult.textContent = `You are paying with MasterCard`;
        }
        else if (payPalBtn.checked) {
            paymentResult.textContent = `You are paying with PayPal`;
        }
        else {
            paymentResult.textContent = `You must select a payment type`;
        }
    }
]



// TERNARY OPERATOR IN JAVASCRIPT \\
IT'S A SHORT-CUT TO IF{} AND ELSE{} STATEMENTS.
HELPS TO ASSIGN A VARIABLE BASED ON A CONDITION.
TERNARY OPERATOR STRUCTURE = [ condition ? codeIf_True : codeIf_False; ]

-- ASSIGN A VARIABLE BASED ON A CONDITION --
[
    let age = 21;
    let message = age >= 18 ? "You're an adult" : "You're a minor";
]



// SWITCHES IN JAVASCRIPT \\
Switch can be a efficient replacement to many else-if statements.

-- EXAMPLE 1 -- ( DAY 1-TO-7 )[

    let day = 1;
    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            console.log(`Monday`);
            break;
        case 2:
            console.log(`Tuesday`);
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log(`Wenessday`);
            break;
        case 4:
            console.log(`Thurday`);
            break;
        case 5:
            console.log(`Friday`);
            break;
        case 6:
            console.log(`Saturday`);
            break;
        case 7:
            console.log(`Sunday`);
            break;  
        default:
            console.log(`${day} Is not a day`);
            break;
    }
]

-- EXAMPLE 2 -- ( SCORE SHEET )[

    let testScore = 100;
    let GradeLetter;

    switch (true) {
        case testScore >= 90:
            GradeLetter = `A`;
            break;
        case testScore >= 80:
            GradeLetter = `B`;
            break;
        case testScore >= 70:
            GradeLetter = `C`;
            break;
        case testScore >= 60:
            GradeLetter = `D`;
            break;  
        default:
            GradeLetter = `F`;
            break;
    }

    console.log(GradeLetter);
]



// STRING METHODS IN JS \\
THESE METHODS ALLOW YOU TO MANIPULATE AND WORK WITH TEXT(Strings)
[
    usrName.charAt(0) = find charaters by their index.
    usrName.charAt('D') = get index of charater.
    usrName.length = get length of charaters.
    usrName.trim = remove space before and after charaters.
    usrName.toUpperCase() = all charaters to uppercase.
    usrName.toLowerCase() = all charaters to lowercase.
    usrName.repeat(20) = you can repeat a text a number of times just put the number here [ repeat(4); ]
    CASE-SENSETIVE
    usrName.startsWith('Dh') =  RETURN A BOOLERN, check if it starts with something.
    usrName.endsWith('pe') = RETURN A BOOLERN, check if it ends with something.
    usrName.includes('pe') = the include
    usrName.replaceAll('o', '0')
    usrName.padStart(20, "B") = start the string with 'B' untill it reaches 20 length long.
    usrName.padEnd(20, "B") = end the string with 'B' untill it reaches 20 length long.
]



// STRING SLICING IN JS \\
THIS IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING A SUBSTRING, FROM A PORTION OF ANOTHER STRING.
usrName.slice(start, end) RTHIS USES INDEX TO FIND charaters.

let usrName = "Dhope NATION";
usrName.slice(0, 5) = get first name
usrName.slice(6, 12) = get last name
usrName.slice(-1) = get last charater
usrName.slice(0, 1) = get first charater

TO MAKE CODE ABOVE DYNAMIC let use the 'indexOf()'
[
    fnam = usrName.slice(0, usrName.indexOf(" ")); 
    lnam = usrName.slice(usrName.indexOf(" ") + 1); // the '+ 1' means plus any other charaters that come after. 
]

EXAMPLE 1 LET'S GET USERNAME FROM EMAIL
[
    let email = `dhope@gmail.com`;
    let username = email.slice(0, email.indexOf("@"));
    let extension = email.slice(email.indexOf("@") + 1);
    
    console.log(username);
    console.log(extension);
]



// METHOD CHAINING IN JS \\
IT'S THE PROCESS OF CALLING ONE METHOD AFTER ANOTHER IN ONE CONTINUOUS LINE OF CODE.
EXAMPLE
[
    let username = window.prompt("Enter your username: ");

    username = username.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + username.trim().slice(1).toLowerCase();
    console.log(username);
]



// LOGICAL OPERATOR IN JS \\
[
    AND = &&
    OR = ||
    NOT = !
]



// EQUALITY OPERATOR IN JS \\
[
    [ = ] assignment operator.
    [ == ] comparison operator.
    [ === ] strict equality operator (compare if value and datatype are equal).
    [ != ] inequality operator.
    [ !== ] strict inequality operator.
]



// WHILE-LOOP IN JS \\
REPEAT SOME CODE WHILE SOME CONDITION IS TRUE.
EXAMPLE
[
    let username = "";

    while (username === "" || username === null) {
        username = window.prompt(`Enter your name: `)
    }

    console.log(`Hello ${username}`);
]

THERE ALSO DO-WHILE LOOP WHICH RUNS THE CODE ONCE BEFORE CHECKING THE CONDITION
[
    let username = "";

    do {
        username = window.prompt(`Enter your name: `)
    } while (username === "" || username === null)

    console.log(`Hello ${username}`);
]



// FOR-LOOP IN JS \\
REPEAT SOME CODE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIMES.
EXAMPLE
[
    for (let index = 0; index < 30; index++) {

        if (index == 13) {
            // 'continue' is the JUMP in JavaScript
            continue;
        }
        else if (index == 21) {
            // 'break' is the STOP in JavaScript
            break;
        } 
        else {
            console.log(`${index} still`)
        }
        
    }

    console.log(`BROKE OUT OF LOOP yeah`)

]



// SPREAD OPERATOR ~ under array \\
The Spread operator is represented by 3-dots(...) allows an iterable 
such as an array or string to be expanded into separate elements (unpacks the elements)

EXAMPLE 1
IMAGINE HAVING AN ARRAY OF NUMBERS, FINDING THE MAX/MIN IS A PROBLEM BUT The Spread operator SLOVES IT.
[
    // PROBLEM
    let numbers =[1, 5, 2, 3, 4] 
    console.log( Math.max(numbers) );
    THE CODE ABOVE WILL GIVE YOU 'NaN' WHICH MEANS IT'S NOT A NUMBER.

    // TO SLOVE THIS, USE THE SPREAD OPERATOR TO UNPACK(SPREAD) EVERY ELEMENT ONE BY ONE.
    console.log(Math.max(...numbers));
    console.log(Math.min(...numbers));
]

EXAMPLE 2
WE HAVE STRING VARIABLE [username = "dhope"] convert it to an array.
[
    let username = "dhope";
    let letters =  [...username]
    console.log(letters);
    THIS WILL BE THE OUTPUT: ['d', 'h', 'o', 'p', 'e'] IT'S HAS BEEN SPREAD OUT, ONE BY ONE

    WE CAN JOIN THEM TOGETHER, WITH A CHARATER IN-BETWEEN THEM
    let letters =  [...username].join()
    console.log(letters);
    THE DEFAULT CHARATER IS ',' : d,h,o,p,e

    TO HAVE NO SPACES BETWEEN THEM, USE CODE BELOW
    [ let letters =  [...username].join("") ] OUTPUT: dhope

    TO SET A CHARATER BETWEEN THEM, USE CODE BELOW
    [ let letters =  [...username].join("-") ] OUTPUT: d-h-o-p-e
]

EXAMPLE 3
WE CAN JOIN TWO OR MORE ARRAYS 
[
    let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
    let vegetable = ["carrots", "celery", "potatoes"];

    let foods = [...fruits, ...vegetable];
    console.log(foods);
    OUTPUT WILL BE: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'carrots', 'celery', 'potatoes']

    WE CAN EVEN APPEND TO THIS ARRAY
    let foods = [...fruits, ...vegetable, "eggs", "milk"];
    console.log(foods);
    OUTPUT WILL BE: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'carrots', 'celery', 'potatoes', 'egg', 'milk']
]



// REST PARAMETERS ~ under arrays \\
REST PARAMETERS ARE PARAMETERS PRE-FIXED WITH 3-DOTS(...rest)
THEY ALLOW A FUNCTION TO WORK WITH A VARIABLE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS
BY BUNDDLING THEM TOGETHER INTO AN ARRAY.

spread = expands an array into separate elements.
rest = bundles separate elements into an array.

EXAMPLE 1
THE REST PARAMETERS IS DESIGNED TO TAKED UNLIMITED NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS
[
    function open_Fridge(...foods) {
        console.log(foods);
        // we can even use spread opeartor here
        //console.log(...foods);
    }

    const food1 = "pizza";
    const food2 = "hamburger";
    const food3 = "hotdog";
    const food4 = "sushi";
    const food5 = "ramen";

    open_Fridge(food1, food2, food3, food4, food5);

]

EXAMPLE 2
LET'S CREATE A FUNCTION TO SUM A BURCH OF NUMBER TOGETHER
[

// CALLBACK IN JS ~ under arrays \\
A CALLBACK IS A FUNCTION THAT IS PASSES AS AN ARGUMENT, 
TO ANOTHER FUNCTION.
!! DON'T ADD '()' WHEN PASSING A FUNCTION AS AN ARGUMENT, JUST WRTIE THE NAME !!

THEY ARE USED TO HANDLE asynchronous operations such as:
1. Reading a file
2. Network requests
3. Interacting with databases

THESE ACTIVITIES TAKE SOME TIME TO COMPLETE, 
JS DOES'NT WAIT FOR A PROCESS TO FINISH BEFORE CONTINUEING WITH THE REST OF THE PROGRAM.

By Using Callback we're garateing, 
that the function passed as an argument, will execute next.

EXAMPLE 1
[
    hello(hi);

    function hello(callback) {
        // time to display is 3 seconds
        setTimeout( function (){
            console.log("Hello 👋");
            callback();
        }, 3000);
    }

    function hi() {
        console.log('Hi There, 🙂');
    }
]

EXAMPLE 2
[
    // SWITCH BETWEEN CONSOLE AND PAGE DISPLAY
    sum(display_Console, 3, 4);

    function sum(callback, num1, num2) {
        let result = num1 + num2;
        callback(result);
    }

    function display_Console(result) {

// FOREACH METHOD IN JS ~ under arrays \\
FOREACH is used to iterate(loop) over(through) the elements of an array,
and apply a specified function(callback) to each element.
[
    array_name.forEach(callback);
    BY DEFAULT(behide-the-sense) THE element, index, array are provided in the forEach method.
    element = the values in the array.
    index = [0,1,2] used to keep track of the element.
    array = the name of the array(argument) passed on to the forEach Method. 

    EXAMPLE 1
    Print elements of an array one by one
    [
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        numbers.forEach(display);

        function display(element) {
            console.log(element);
        }
    ]

    EXAMPLE 2
    Let's double the elements of an array one by one
    [
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        numbers.forEach(double);

        }

        function display(element) {
            console.log(element)
        }
    ]

    EXAMPLE 3 
    Let's square the elements of an array one by one
    [
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        numbers.forEach(square);
        numbers.forEach(display);

        function square(element, index, array) {
            array[index] = Math.pow(element, 2)
        }

        function display(element) {
            console.log(element)
        }

// map() Method in JS ~ under arrays  \\
The map() Method accepts a callback, and applies that function
to each element of an array, then return a NEW ARRAY.
very similer to forEach method BUT this one return a NEW ARRAY thats the only difference.

[
    EXAMPLE 1
    Let's square some numbers

    EXAMPLE 2 
    Let's cube these numbers
    [
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        let cube_Nums = numbers.map(cube);

            console.log("Good Day");
        }, 
        3000
    );
]



// 'this' IN JS \\
this = it's a reference to the object which where 'this' is used.
(as long as we're within the context of the object, 'this' can be used)
(this is a reference to the object we're within)

'this' DOSE NOT WORK WITH Arrow Functions.

EXAMPLES
[
    let person = {
        name: 'Theophilus',
        age: 23,
        favFood: "Rice",
        say_HELLO: function () {console.log(`i'm ${this.name}`)},
        eat: function () {console.log(`i'm eating ${this.favFood}`)}
    }

    person.say_HELLO()
    person.eat()
]



// CONSTRUCTOR IN JS \\
IT'S A SPECIAL METHOD FOR DEFINING THE 
PROPERTIES AND METHODS OF AN OBJECT.
EXAMPLE 
[
    // CONSTRUCTOR
    // THIS IS HOW TO CREATE A CONSTRUCTOR.

// CLASSES IN JS \\
A CLASS IS A (ES6 FEATURE) THAT PROVIDES A MORE STRUCTURED AND CLEANER WAY TO
WORK WITH OBJECTS, COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS.
ex. static keyword, encapsulation, inheritance.

! within a class you don't need to write 'function' when your creating a function !

[
    class Product {

// static keyword IN JS \\
STATIC IS A KEYWORD THAT DEFINES PROPERTIES OR METHODS THAT BELONG
TO A CLASS ITSELF RATHER THAN THE OBJECT CREATED FROM THAT CLASS.
(class owns anything decared static, and not any other objects created from that class)

// getters and setters IN JS \\
getter = ARE SPECIAL METHOD THAT MAKE A PROPERTY READABLE.
setter =  ARE SPECIAL METHOD THAT MAKE A PROPERTY WRITEABLE.

YOU CAN USE GETTER AND SETTER TO VALIDATE AND MODIFY A VALUE WHEN READING/WRITING A PROPERTY.

// classList in JS \\
IT'S AN ELEMENT PROPERTY, IT'S USED TO INTERACT
WITH AN ELEMENT'S LIST OF CLASSES, MEANING CSS CLASSES.
ALLOWS US TO MAKE REUSEABLE CLASSES FOR MANY ELEMENTS
ACCROSS THE WEBPAGE.

IF I HAVE A CSS CLASS, I CAN DYNAMICALLY 
add(), remove(), toggle(), replace(), 
OR CHECK IF AN ELEMENT CONTAINS A CLASS contains().

[
    EXAMPLE -1-
    ADD AN ELEMENT TO A CSS CLASS
    [
        const my_Button = document.getElementById("mybutton");
        // the name of the class, I want my_Button to be added to is [enabled]
        my_Button.classList.add("enabled");
    ]

    EXAMPLE -2-
    TO REMOVE AN ELEMENT TO A CSS CLASS
    [
        const my_Button = document.getElementById("mybutton");
       
        my_Button.classList.remove("enabled");
    ]

    EXAMPLE -3-
    TOGGLE BETWEEN CSS CLASSES
    [
        const my_Button = document.getElementById("mybutton");
        
        // FIRST TOGGLE WILL ADD IT.
        my_Button.addEventListener("mouseover", event => {
            event.target.classList.toggle("hover");
        })

        // SECOND TOGGLE WILL REMOVE IT.
        my_Button.addEventListener("mouseout", event => {
            event.target.classList.toggle("hover");
        })
    ]

    EXAMPLE -4-
    REPLACE THE OLD CSS CLASS WITH A NEW CSS CLASS
    NEW CLASS IS CLASSED [disabled]
    [
        const my_Button = document.getElementById("mybutton");
        
        my_Button.classList.add("enabled");

        // FIRST TOGGLE WILL ADD IT.
        my_Button.addEventListener("click", event => {
            // replace("old_class", "new_class");
            event.target.classList.replace("enabled", "disabled");
        })
    ]

    EXAMPLE -5-
    IF AN ELEMENT CONTAINS A CLASS IT WILL RETURN TRUE.
    [
        const my_Button = document.getElementById("mybutton");
        
        my_Button.classList.add("enabled");

        // FIRST TOGGLE WILL ADD IT.

// FETCH DATA FROM AN API in JS \\
IT'S A FUNCTION USED FOR MAKING HTTP REQUESTE TO FETCH RESOURCES.
SUCH AS: (JSON styled data, images, files).
THE fetch FUNCTION SIMPLIFIES asynchronous data fetching in JS and 
used for interacting with APIs to retrive and send data asynchronously over the web.

FETCH HAS TWO ARGUMENTS
fetch(url, {option})
url = location of data.
!! BUT WE DON'T NEED TO STATE THE {option} !!
option = DEFAULT is {method: "GET"} = TO GET DATA
         {method: "POST"} = TO SEND DATA
         {method: "PUT"} = TO REPLACE DATA
         {method: "DELETE"} = TO DELETE DATA

[
    // HTTP response status codes \\
    [
        HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific
        HTTP request has been successfully completed.
        Response are grouped in five classes.
        1. Information Response { 100 - 199 }
        1. Successful Response { 200 - 299 }
        1. Redirection Response { 300 - 399 }
        1. Client error Response { 400 - 499 }
        1. Server error Response { 500 - 599 }
